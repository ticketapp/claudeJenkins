    Globally enable v2 API usage.
    <p>When v2 API is enabled, the auth tokens stored within the Jenkins configuration will have to be valid OAuth2
        access tokens with send_notification scope. The "Send As" setting value will not have an effect, as HipChat will
        use the OAuth2 access token's "label" as sender.</p>
    <p>When disabled, the auth tokens needs to be regular HipChat v1 API tokens and the value of the "Send As" setting
        is obeyed.</p>
